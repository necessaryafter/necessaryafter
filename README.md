# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Welcome to my little corner on GitHub!

I'm someone who loves turning ideas into code since I was 14. I started messing around with JavaScript, and over time I dived deep into the Java ecosystem â€” nowadays, I split my time between Java and Kotlin, always trying to make my projects cleaner, faster, and better organized.

# ðŸ§­ What do I usually work with?  
Here are some of the technologies Iâ€™m most familiar with or have hands-on experience using:
